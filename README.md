# DeepVision3
"AI-Powered Real-Time Incident and Weapon Detection System: A machine learning-based project designed to enhance security using AI and computer vision. It can detect theft, unauthorized access, violence, and weapons  real time, providing alerts and loggings. Built with YOLOv8 and TensorFlow, It leverages CCTV cameras monitoring homes, public places
# DeepVision - A real time Crime Detector in CCTV Camera

DeepVision is an intelligent video surveillance solution powered by Google Gemini. It analyzes live video or recorded footage in real-time to detect potential security threats such as weapons and physical altercations, providing immediate visual and audio alerts via Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.

## Features

*   **Real-time Threat Detection:** Utilizes Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze video frames for suspicious activities.
*   **Supports Multiple Sources:** Can process pre-recorded video files or capture live feed from a webcam.
*   **Audible Alerts:** Uses Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and `playsound` to notify operators of detected threats.
*   **Interactive Display:** Shows the video feed, current detection status (NORMAL/ABNORMAL), a description of the scene, and prominent visual cues for active alerts.
*   **Alert Acknowledgment:** Operators can acknowledge alerts (by pressing 'c'), stopping repeating audio notifications.
*   **Configurable:** Allows setting the frame processing interval, API key, and alert cooldown periods.
*   **Environment-Friendly:** Leverages `.env` files for secure API key management.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   A Google AI (Gemini) API Key
*   (For audio alerts) A working sound output. `playsound` might require additional system libraries depending on your OS:
    *   **Linux:** May require `mpg123` or `gstreamer` (`sudo apt-get install mpg123` or appropriate gstreamer packages).
    *   **macOS/Windows:** Often works out-of-the-box.

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone (https://github.com/Makobi5/DeepVision.git) # 
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    The script is often run within a virtual environment named `myenv`.

    *   **For Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv myenv
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **For macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv myenv
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file should be included in the repository.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If `requirements.txt` is not present, you can create it after manually installing the necessary packages (see below) in your virtual environment:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Key dependencies include: `google-generativeai`, `gTTS`, `playsound`, `opencv-python`, `python-dotenv`, `Pillow`.

4.  **Set up your API Key:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root project directory (alongside `detect.py`). Add your Google AI API Key to this file:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your valid key.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can run the `detect.py` script from your activated virtual environment (`myenv`).

**1. Analyzing a video file:**

Provide the path to the video file as a command-line argument.
```bash
python detect.py path/to/your/video.avi or --webcam to pick footage from webcam
